# Hello-World

<h1>About Me!</h1>
<p>I am new to the coding world.I had a rather nasty disorder that made me uber obsessive. And no, it was not OCD.Point being - the thing that helped me by was any thing technology related. I'm hoping I can learn as much as I can before going to school  next year for programming.</p>

<h2>first committ</h2>
<p>I'm going to start by sticking to what I know and creating an HTML5 file and use CSS for styling.</p>
